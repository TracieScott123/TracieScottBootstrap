# TracieScottBootstrap
This assignment called for four bootstrap routines to demonstrate the Central Limit theorum. 
Each knir file contains 1 bootstrap routine with associated charts and some interpretation of those results.
bootstrap_knitr1 - bootstrap with a normal distribution and a sample size of 5
bootstrap_knitr2 - bootstrap with a normal distribution with a sample size of 16 
bootstrap_knitr3 - bootstrap with an exponential distribution with a sample size of 5 with a rate of .2
bootstrap_knitr4 - bootstrap with an exponential distribution with a sample size of 15 with a rate of .2
Each file creates a vector of means representing the bootstrap data adn then creates a histogram and qq-plot for the data.
