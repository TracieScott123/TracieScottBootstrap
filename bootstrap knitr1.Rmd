## First normal distribution example; sample size 5

```{r FirstNormal}
# normal bootstrap
R <- 1000                                    # R: number of replications
bootmean <- numeric(R)                       # bootmean: vector of mean values w R values
x <-c (23.3, 26.1, 19.0, 28.8, 29.0)         # X: vector containing the sample to bootstrap
FirstMean <- mean(x)                         # FirstMean: mean of the first sample
bootSE <- sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))              # bootSE: SE of the first sample

for (i in 1:R) {                             # create a loop from 1 to R  (replications)
  # create a new sample based on the original sample with replacement) 
  bootsample <- sample(x, size=length(x), replace=TRUE)     
   # append the mean of the new sample to a vector
  bootmean[i] <- mean(bootsample)                          
}

```

## Diagnostics
```{r variables}
x                                            # display X (sample)
FirstMean                                    # display Firstmean (mean of the sample)
bootSE                                       # display bootSE (SE for the sample)  
summary(bootmean)                             # 5 number summary of vector containing bootstrap sample means
```

```{r histogram}
hist(bootmean)                              # histogram of mean scores from bootstrap vector
```

* histogram - note normal distribution of mean values generated from 1000 samples; mean is close to the original mean

```{r qqplot}
qqnorm(bootmean)                            # qqplot of mean scores from bootstrap vector
```
* QQPlot - mean values conform to the diagonal of the qqplot
